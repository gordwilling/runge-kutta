Ordinary Differential Equation Solver.

Implementation of Runge-Kutta in C++ 

This particular implementation is used for simulating the dynamics of an Inverted Pendulum on a Cart, but most of the code is generally applicable.

Typically such systems are modeled in Matlab, which supplies an assortment of ready-made solvers, but this project required a standalone implementation in C++
